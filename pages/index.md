# Developer Docs

At CarbonPlan, we build a projects using a wide varity of open source tools and technologies. This site provides documentation aimed at supporting our core software, data, and science development activities.

Our work can be roughly divided into two areas, [front-end](/front-end) and [data-science](/data-science). Because these areas often utilize very different toolsets and development approaches, this site provides individudal guides for each area.
